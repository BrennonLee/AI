    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Moodle by **4 PM on Friday 4 May 2018**.  Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/LateX directly below the associated question. Your solutions to computational questions should include any relevant Python code, as well as results and any written commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis must be **your own**.\n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, in-class notebooks and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions, like the form of a probability distribution function, or how to perform a particular operation in Python.\n",
    "1. You may **not** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "1. **You may not collaborate with classmates or anyone else.**\n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your final exam. So, I will be much less helpful than I typically am with homework. For example, I will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If you have a question, post it first as a **private** Piazza message. If I decide that it is appropriate for the entire class, then I will make it a public post (and anonymous).\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is probably because I intend for you to code it up however you want, and only care about the plots/analysis I see at the end. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of these rules will result in an **F** and a trip to the Honor Code council.\n",
